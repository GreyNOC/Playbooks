# GreyNOC Security Playbooks

Production-grade detection, response, and authorized-testing playbooks authored by the GreyNOC detection-engineering team. The library spans two complementary collections:

- **Detection & Response** — behavior-based SOC playbooks across the intrusion lifecycle, from initial access to impact.
- **AI · Post-Quantum · E2EE** — playbooks re-centered on the cryptographic transition: post-quantum (PQ) migration, end-to-end-encrypted (E2EE) protocol security, and AI-augmented detection, plus two dedicated to authorized bug-bounty methodology against PQ/E2EE attack surface.

Every playbook follows the same GreyNOC structure: overview, MITRE ATT&CK / ATLAS mapping, detection strategy, indicators, sample logic, example data, investigation steps, false positives, tuning, response actions, escalation criteria, an analyst-notes template, and a closing summary. Written for SOC analysts, IR, detection engineers, and authorized offensive operators. Behavior-based over signature-based; operational clarity over theory.

> **Why the crypto collection.** NIST finalized the first PQ standards in August 2024 (FIPS 203 ML-KEM, FIPS 204 ML-DSA, FIPS 205 SLH-DSA), with FN-DSA (FIPS 206) and the HQC backup KEM following. Hybrid TLS (`X25519MLKEM768`, NamedGroup `0x11EC`) is now default or near-default across Chrome, Firefox, Cloudflare, Akamai, and AWS, and E2EE messengers (Signal PQXDH, iMessage PQ3) ship PQ key establishment in production. The window where "crypto detection" meant "expired certs and weak ciphers" is closed. The dominant risk is now **harvest-now-decrypt-later (HNDL)**, **downgrade of hybrid handshakes**, and **migration-defect classes** introduced while organizations swap primitives under deadline.

A visual index of the detection & response collection is available in [index.html](index.html).

## How to Use

1. Read the playbook end-to-end before deploying any rule.
2. Map data sources to your environment; verify telemetry sufficiency before relying on a detection. PQ/E2EE detection in particular depends on handshake- and key-level visibility that many estates do not yet log — confirm you have it before trusting the absence of alerts.
3. Translate the JSON-shaped sample logic to your platform (KQL, SPL, EQL, Sigma, etc.); validate on historical data where possible.
4. Adopt the analyst-notes template into your case-management workflow.
5. For the bug-bounty playbooks (crypto collection 07–08), do not begin any activity without a signed authorization / program scope on file. GreyNOC operates as the submitting firm; ROE in CONVENTIONS is mandatory.
6. Revisit tuning after every confirmed true positive and false positive.
